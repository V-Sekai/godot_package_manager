# Godot Package Manager
A package manager for Godot 3.x. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) allows for arbitrary
packages to be uploaded, so why not upload Godot addons there to be automatically
managed?

### Note
This addon itself has an implicit dependency on [advanced-expression-gd](https://github.com/you-win/advanced-expression-gd),
which will be automatically pulled before pulling other dependencies.

## `godot.package`
Describes packages to be installed along with run hooks. This _should_ be modified
by the user.

Note: unrecognized fields will be ignored. This can be useful for storing additional data or notes.

```JSON
{
    "packages": {
        "simple_package_name": "version_string",
        "complex_package_name": {
            "version": "version_string",
            "required_when": "expression",
            "optional_when": "expression"
        }
    },
    "hooks": {
        "pre_update": "expression",
        "post_update": {
            "type": "gdscript, terminal, shell, batch, powershell",
            "file": "relative/path/to/script",
            "command": "expression",
            "args": [
                "string_arg"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## `godot.lock`
Keeps track of currently installed packages.

This is auto-generated by the addon and should not be modified manually.

```JSON
{
    "package_name": "version_string"
}
```
